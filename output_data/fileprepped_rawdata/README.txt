README

This datafile is the output from `DICTA_fileprep.ipynb` Notebook. 

This "prepped" file ideally contains at least salinity measurements associated to each DIC/TA sample, and perhaps also nutrients and other auxiliary/meta data that will make calculations down the line easer and more streamlined.
