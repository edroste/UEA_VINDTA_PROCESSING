Processing DIC and TA from raw UEA VINDTA data ouput

1. File preparations (fileprep)

Go through the summary.csv raw data output file from the VINDTA and do the following: 
- Make necessary corrections to metadata
- Make necessary corrections to filenaming (here, .dat filenames might have to be corrected, too! Be cautious.)
- Merge auxiliary data from other datafiles (e.g. salinity and nutrients from CTD bottle files)

2. Calculate DIC content (DIC_CRMs_QC)

- Add CRM certified values in respective columns
- Perform preliminary DIC calculations using all CRMs
- QC CRMs
- Re-do DIC calculations with only the "good" CRM runs
- Identify need and assess relevance of drift corrections

3. Calculate TA content (TA_CRMs_QC)

- Assign HCl batches
- Determine HCl concentration
- QC CRMs based on acid titrant concentration
- Perform preliminary TA calculations using all CRMs
- QC CRMs based on TA
- Re-do TA calculations using only "good" CRM runs

4. QC DIC and TA of samples (DICTA_samples_QC)
- QC DIC values
- QC TA values
